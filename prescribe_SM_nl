# EXAMPLE Namelist to prescribe SM
#
# The model needs to find this file. Put it in the
# run directory that clm uses.
#
# Negative values in the pSMfile are not overwritten
# in the model -> these points are calculated inter-
# actively.
#
# ! CAREFUL !
# If you provide a daily data set and use monthly = .true.
# it will still work. It just prescribes the values of the
# first 12 days!
#
#
#pSMfile : string
#    path to the history file containing SOILLIQ and SOILICE
#monthly : bool
#    If .true. assumes monthly mean SM is provided. If false uses daily input.
#pSMtype : int, {1, 2, 3}
#    Defines how to prescribe SM. 1: default: prescribe SOILLIQ and SOILICE. 2: prescribe SM only if there is no SOILICE present (never prescribes SOILICE). Lets the model decide if there is ICE or not at a certain gridpoint. 3: yields no physically sensible output.
